To determine the cell cycle coherence, we looked at two metrics: the angular and radial distribution of the cells around the torus. These two metrics are illustrated in the image below.\n\n ![image](/assets/img/gaglia-PCQ-2020/Torus_Def.png)\n\n A cell population displays cell cycle coherence when the cell cycle protein markers fluctuate in an organized and coordinated pattern across the populations of cells. When this is the case the points in the reduced dimensionality plot (i.e. the cells' representation) are both 1) spread out and close to outer toric shape and 2) evenly distributed around the contours of the torus (i.e. low distance from the circle fit and low angular variability).\n\n Each ROI's cells arrange themselves into the cell cycle differently, and therefore have different values for theta and d, different distributions of cell cycle markers and visually different tori. ROIs 30, 8, and 10 are shown below to illustrate this.\n \n\n ![image](/assets/img/gaglia-PCQ-2020/ROI_Tori.png)\n\n Below is a static plot showing all the ROIs' cell cycle coherence metrics.\n\n\n ![image](/assets/img/gaglia-PCQ-2020/Harmony.png) "}]}]},
