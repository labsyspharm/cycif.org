CCOC invades surrounding structures and carries a risk of recurrence and metastasis to regional lymph nodes and distant sites (1). More than 80% of CCOCs exhibit EWSR1 gene rearrangement (1,2). The standard of care is surgical gross total resection with wide margins. For cases where surgical margins are close, adjuvant radiotherapy may be administered to reduce the risk of recurrence.\n\nThe image shows a CCOC tissue section subjected to tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence (t-CyCIF) stained with different markers to identify tumor, vasculature, and immune cells. T-CyCIF is a method that allows tissue to be probed for up to 60 different proteins in the same sample, providing a comprehensive view of signaling pathways involved in tumor progression and spatial characterization of the tumor microenvironment (3). In this Minerva story, we show a selection of markers that allow the viewer to visualize different cell populations present in the tumor microenvironment of CCOC. \n\nReferences:\n1. Wright, J.
