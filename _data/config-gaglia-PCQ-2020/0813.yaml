  Header: |
    Cell proliferation is a defining feature of malignancy. Our understanding of this fundamental 
    process is derived from monocultures of cells propagated under synthetic conditions. However, 
    tumors are complex mixtures of cell types and populations comprising proliferative, non-proliferative 
    and arrested states. Images of single or small sets of protein markers from fixed tissue samples 
    only provide limited and static views into the nature of these complex states.  We designed a 
    multivariate quantitative framework for characterizing cellular proliferation and cell cycle 
    dynamics in tissue sections.
    
    This story contextualizes these new metrics of Multivariate Proliferation Index (MPI) and cell 
    cycle harmony in an untreated human HER2 positive primary breast cancer resection.

    First, we use established lineage markers (CD45, Vimentin, e-Cadherin and aSMA) to distinguish 
    epithelial cells from immune and stromal cells (Waypoint 3. Cell Typing).

    Then we use proliferation and cell cycle arrest markers to define a Multivariate Proliferation 
    Index, or MPI (Waypoint 4-7).

    Finally we focus on the proliferative population (MPI+1) and extract cell cycle protein dynamics 
    from tissue images (Waypoint 8-9).

        Multiplexed images were generated using tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence (t-CyCIF) with a 
        20X/0.75NA objective.

        Following acquisition, images are aligned and the fluorescent intensity for each marker was measured. 
        The individual markers are visible in the Channels tab on the right of the screen.
        
        The following waypoints of this story show how we use groups of markers - found under Channel Groups 
        on the right of the screen - to assign cell type and to ascribe cells a ternary proliferation state 
        and time point in the cell cycle.

        You can change the marker set show by clicking the links in Channels tab on the right side of the screen.

        You will also be able to review the cell typing calls we made, as well as the proliferation and cell 
        cycle characterization by toggling the Data Layers masks below the text.

        Finally, the data plots within each waypoint are interactive! Click on them to visualize cell type 
        clusters or single cell within a scatter plot.

        \ In our study we found that Ki67 was extremely specific at detecting proliferating MPI+1\

      Description: "Following a pathology review of the tissue, we created an toric cell\
      \ cycle plot for each distinct ROI and fit a circle to the 2D dimensionally reduced plot.\
      \ To determine the cell cycle harmony, we looked at\
      \ two metrics: the angular and radial distribution of the cells around the torus.\
      \ These two metrics are illustrated in the image below.\n\

      \ ![image](/assets/img/gaglia-PCQ-2020/Torus_Def.png)\n\

      \ A cell population displays cell cycle harmony when the cell cycle protein markers\
      \ fluctuate in an organized and coordinated pattern across the populations of cells.\
      \ When this is the case the points in the reduced dimensionality plot (i.e. the cells'\
      \ representation) are both 1) spread out and close to outer toric shape and 2)\
      \ evenly distributed around the contours of the torus (i.e. low distance from the circle\
      \ fit and low angular variability).\n\

      \ Each ROI's cells arrange themselves into the cell cycle differently, and therefore\
      \ have different values for theta and d, different distributions of cell cycle markers\
      \ and visually different tori. ROIs 30, 8, and 10 are shown below to illustrate this.\n \n\

      \ ![image](/assets/img/gaglia-PCQ-2020/ROI_Tori.png)\n\
      
      \ Below is a static plot showing all the ROIs' cell cycle harmony metrics.\n\n\
