    "Header": "Within tuberculosis (TB)-infected lungs, granulomas are the sites of chronic lung inflammation caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and the host immune response. Mtb growth is often limited within a granuloma, but these sites provide a niche from which bacteria can persist or spread. Although the classical structure of granulomas was described around 200 years ago, there is still much unknown about the specific molecular mechanisms that contribute to the progression of TB from an active to a latent infection (and vice versa).\n\nHere, we use two images of a TB-infected lung to illustrate how TB granulomas progress during the disease. First, we show H&E images \u2013 a clinical standard for TB diagnosis. Second, we use highly multiplexed imaging to reveal molecular insight into what\u2019s happening at each stage.\n\nWe recommend that you look at the [first story in the series](./features.html) to get oriented to the tissue sample before going through this story.",

Those that surround and interact with the B and T cells perform as antigen presenting cells. Other macrophages in the core continue to phagocytose Mtb. \n\n**B cells (`CD20`)** aggregate at the edge of the granuloma. They are responsible for antibody production. \n\n**T cells (`CD3D`)** gather at the edges of B cell aggregates (follicles) and promote antibody development. \n\nA closer look at the T cell population reveals two types of T cells, **cytotoxic T cells (`CD8A`)** and **T helper cells (`CD4`)**. *Switch to the T cells channel group to see them* \n\nCytotoxic T cells can directly eliminate infected macrophages. T helper cells instruct macrophages to kill Mtb and interact with the aggregated B cells to inform antibody development.\n",

The resulting fibrotic granuloma is quite distinct from the original alveolar structure of the lung - unfortunately, lung function in this healed granuloma is permanently lost. \n\nIt\u2019s not known if bacteria are still present in the fibrotic granuloma at this point. In this patient biopsy, no bacteria were visible with acid-fast staining (a stain that identifies Mtb), but histological samples represent only a two-dimensional slice of the three-dimensional granuloma. The presence of numerous necrotic (caseous) granulomas in this patient suggests ongoing Mtb infection despite not detecting bacteria in the biopsy. In addition to a biopsy, clinicians use additional methods for diagnosing infection status, such as a sputum culture, where a sample of phlegm from a patient\u2019s cough is collected and monitored for several days to see if any bacteria grow within the sample.",
