    "Header": "Globally, tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death from an infectious disease. Although there has been progress to reduce TB deaths over the past two decades, the current approaches to treating TB remain inadequate. \n\nTB infection in the lung is associated with the formation of **granulomas**, the result of the immune response to clear the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Understanding the key interactions between immune cells that occur within the granulomas may help identify ways to improve the diagnosis and treatment of TB.\n\n*Here, we use two images of a lung infected with tuberculosis to illustrate the classical hallmarks of a TB granuloma.* \n\nFirst, we show a tissue section of a tuberculosis infected lung stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). H&E images are the gold standard method for diagnosing tuberculosis clinically, so there are many classical hallmarks of TB that can be visualized in this image.\n\nSecond, we show a subsequent tissue section that was subjected to tissue cyclic immunofluorescence [(t-CyCIF)](https://elifesciences.org/articles/31657), a cyclical method for antibody staining and fluorescent imaging. Multiplexed imaging can reveal molecular information that could help identify better TB treatments in the future. ",

Lung tissue is primarily made up of three parts:\n\n1. **Airways** \u2013 In the center of the sample, a major airway structure is visible.\n2. **Alveoli** - The lung is made up of many air sacs \u2013 known as alveoli \u2013 where CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> exchange occurs while breathing. Many alveoli are present in normal lung tissue, as seen on the top left. \n3. **Blood vessels** \u2013 Blood vessels are critical for gas exchange in the lung. We highlight two \u2013 a cross section in the center of the tissue that has a distinct ring of smooth muscle and another to the right where the length of the vessel is visible.\n\nThis lung is infected with tuberculosis and has a number of **granulomas** \u2013 these are the active sites of inflammation due to tuberculosis infection. Here, we highlight two but many more are visible. \n\nThe red region in the lower right is a hemorrhage \u2013 this tissue sample was taken as a biopsy, so some bleeding has likely happened while the biopsy was being taken. You can zoom in to see the red blood cells in this region.",

In TB, some macrophages attempt to phagocytose (eat) TB bacteria to neutralize infection, but Mtb is well-equipped to deal with the macrophage\u2019s defense mechanisms. In some macrophage-Mtb interactions, instead of phagocytosis killing the bacteria, the bacteria grow and replicate within the macrophage, a process that ultimately kills the macrophage. Within the core, the macrophage staining (`CD68`) represents debris from macrophages that died after being infected with TB. \n\nOther macrophages serve as antigen-presenting cells that work with T cells (`CD3D`). Macrophages located close to T cells (`CD3D`) are likely presenting TB antigens to T cells and activating T cells to help fight the infection or kill infected macrophages. ",
