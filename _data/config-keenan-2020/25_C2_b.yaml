  Header: This is a CyCIF image of a biopsy from a patient with triple-negative breast
    cancer (TNBC) liver metastasis. The biopsy was obtained after combination therapy
    with Cisplatin and the Wee1 inhibitor Adavosertib at cycle 2. According to the
    RECIST 1.1 response evaluation criteria, this patient was classified as having
    progressive disease (PD) after the combination therapy.

      Description: We detected changes in cell cycle markers in the biopsy obtained
        after the combination therapy of Cisplatin and Wee1 inhibitor. Within the
        `pan-cytokeratin`+ tumor cell population, CyCIF revealed that pCDK1/2/3/5 expression
        decreased on average 56%, from monotherapy to combination therapy biopsies,
        indicating target engagement of the Wee1 inhibitor. Similarly, the number
        of pHH3+ tumor cells increased by an average of 28-fold from monotherapy to
        combination therapy biopsies, suggesting increased entry into mitosis after
        Wee1 inhibitor therapy.

      Description: Patients with progressive disease (PD) after combination therapy had
        smaller increases in CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8a+ T cells following Wee1 inhibitor
        therapy versus those with either a partial response (PR) or stable disease
        (SD).
