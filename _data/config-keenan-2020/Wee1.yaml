  Header: 'This is a CyCIF image of a biopsy from a patient with triple-negative breast cancer
    (TNBC) liver metastasis. The biopsy was obtained after combination therapy with Cisplatin
    and the Wee1 inhibitor Adavosertib at cycle 2. According to the RECIST 1.1 response
    evaluation criteria, this patient was classified as having a partial response (PR)
    to the combination therapy.

      Description: We detected changes in cell cycle markers on the biopsy obtained after the combination therapy of Cisplatin
        and Wee1 inhibitor. Within the pan-cytokeratin+ tumor cell population, CyCIF revealed
        that pCDK1/2/3/5 expression decreased on average 56%, from monotherapy to combination
        therapy biopsies, indicating target engagement of the Wee1 inhibitor. Similarly,
        the number of pHH3+ tumor cells increased by an average of 28-fold
        from monotherapy to combination therapy biopsies, suggesting increased
        entry into mitosis after Wee1 inhibitor therapy.

      Description: 'Patients with more favorable responses had increased CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8a+ T cell infiltration following
        Wee1 inhibitor therapy. There were larger increases in CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8a+ T cell populations in patients who had either a partial
        response (PR) or stable disease (SD) versus those with progressive disease (PD).
