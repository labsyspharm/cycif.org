    - Name: Ependymomas
      Group: HnE
      Description: Ependymomas are proliferations of neoplastic cells with histologic, molecular, and ultrastructural similarities to the ependymal cells of the ventricles and spinal canal. Ependymomas are identified in approximately 33-53% of individuals with NF2, most commonly involving the posterior fossa and cervicomedullary region of the spine.

      Description: The majority of NF2-associated ependymomas are W.H.O. grade II lesions with classic histology including peri-vascular pseudo-rosettes and true ependymal rosettes.
