    - Name: Schwannoma
      Group: H&E
      Description: Schwannomas are proliferations of neoplastic cells which exhibit histologic, ultrastructural, and molecular similarities to the Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system (1). Schwannomas are typically benign slow-growing tumors characterized by a well-circumscribed population of spindled cells with clear or amphophilic cytoplasm, though NF2-associated schwannomas may exhibit a variety of unusual features. Development of bilateral vestibular schwannomas is a pathognomonic feature of NF2. The vestibular schwannomas of NF2 are typically multinodular plexiform masses arising from multiple origins along the superior and vestibular branches of the vestibulocochlear nerve (CNVIII) (2). NF2-associated vestibular schwannomas have a higher risk of recurrence than sporadic vestibular schwannomas, but no significantly increased risk of malignant progression unless treated with radiation (3).

    - Name: Antoni A Histology
      Group: H&E
      Description: Schwannomas typically exhibit varying proportion of two basic histologic patterns. Antoni A regions are more cellular regions consisting of densely packed spindle cells with plump elongate nuclei with tapering ends (a characteristic feature of nerve sheath tumors). Focal nuclear pallisading is a characteristic feature of schwannomas, and eosinophilic process-rich anuclear regions interposed with palisading nuclei may produce pathognomonic Verocay bodies. The tumor shown consists almost entirely of Antoni A histology, but shows only subtle palisading and Verocay bodies. NF2-associated vestibular schwannomas more commonly show a predominance of cellular Antoni A pattern, and may show unusual features such as whorled growth and a multilobular appearance, which likely correlates with the plexiform multinodular origin of NF2-associated masses (2), though these features are not prominent in this case.

    - Name: Antoni B Histology
      Group: H&E
      Description: Schwannomas typically exhibit varying proportion of two basic histologic patterns. Antoni B regions are less cellular and often exhibit smaller rounder nuclei with indistinct processes, a more collagenized or myxoid extracellular matrix, and variable lipidization. Verocay bodies are typically not present in Antoni B regions. There is often a sharp delineation between Antoni A and B regions within the tumor. This tumor was almost entirely composed of Antoni A histology, as is often seen in NF2-associated vestibular schwannomas. Antoni B histology likely corresponds with more hyperintense regions on T2-weighted MRI sequences, due to the lower cellularity of these regions.

    - Name: Hypervascularity
      Group: H&E
      Description: Schwannomas are typically hypervascular tumors which may correlate with expression of VEGF in tumor cells, and VEGFR2 in a substantial proportion of vessels (4). The hypervascularity of schwannomas likely correlates with the intense enhancement seen on post-gadolinium MRI sequences.

    - Name: Perivascular Hyalinization
      Group: H&E
      Description: Schwannomas of all anatomic sites characteristically exhibit dense peri-vascular fibrosis (hyalinization). The etiology of this change is not well understood, but may be related to elevated expression of VEGF by the tumor cells (4). Identification of this feature may be useful in diagnosis of schwannomas with unusual histologic features. The vascular changes in schwannomas may result in obliteration of vessels and focal hemorrhage, infarction, and/or microcystic changes. This tumor exhibited particularly prominent peri-vascular hyalinization, and scattered degeneration and vacuolization.

    - Name: Degenerative Changes (Vacuolization/Microcystic Changes)
      Group: H&E
      Description: Schwannomas frequently exhibit a variety of degenerative changes including focal microcystic changes and vacuolization of tumor cells. These changes may be related to vascular abnormalities and hyalinization resulting in focal ischemia and/or hemorrhage.

    - Name: Degenerative Changes (Cytologic Atypia)
      Group: H&E
      Description: Schwannomas frequently exhibit a variety of degenerative changes including focal or diffuse atypical cytologic features including nuclear contour irregularity, nucleomegaly, and/or hyperchromasia. The biological significance of these changes and their consequences for cellular function are not well understood, but they have not been shown to correlate with an increased risk of recurrence or more aggressive behavior. Given that similar morphologic changes may correlate with malignant transformation in other settings, investigation of the etiology of this phenomenon may provide interesting insights into the regulation of nuclear structure and the significance of nuclear atypia in oncogenesis.
