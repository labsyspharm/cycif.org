      Description: Neoplastic cells in both sporadic and NF2-associated schwannomas invariably exhibit strong and diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of the S100 protein, and this is a critical diagnostic feature of these tumors. S100 is a calcium binding protein with a helix-loop-helix conformation which is characteristically expressed in neural crest derived lineages such as Schwann cells, melanocytes, and cartilage as well as adipocytes, histiocytic cells, and breast epithelium. While S100 expression may be present in neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST), it is typically more weak and focal than seen in schwannomas. This tumor shows strong and diffuse S100 staining in both the extraneural and intraneural portions of the tumor.

      Description: S100 immunohistochemistry (IHC) is positive in both the non-neoplastic Schwann cells which myelinate peripheral nerve fibers, as well as the neoplastic cells of the schwannoma. S100 staining highlights whorls of neoplastic schwannoma cells interdigitated between nerve fibers in the intraneural portion of the tumor. Such whorls may reflect the polyclonal multinodular origin of NF2-associated schwannomas (1).
