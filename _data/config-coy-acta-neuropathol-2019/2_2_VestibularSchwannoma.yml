      Description: Neoplastic cells in both sporadic and NF2-associated schwannomas invariably exhibit strong and diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of the S100 protein, and this is a critical diagnostic feature of these tumors. S100 is a calcium binding protein with a helix-loop-helix conformation which is characteristically expressed in neural crest derived lineages such as Schwann cells, melanocytes, and cartilage as well as adipocytes, histiocytic cells, and breast epithelium. While S100 expression may be present in neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST), it is typically more weak and focal than seen in schwannomas. S100 expression is typically weak and focal or absent in fibrous meningiomas and solitary fibrous tumors, which may distinguish these tumors in difficult cases.
