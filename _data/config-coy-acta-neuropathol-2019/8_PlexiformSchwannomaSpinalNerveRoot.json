Schwannomas are typically benign slow-growing tumors characterized by a well-circumscribed population of spindled cells with clear or amphophilic cytoplasm, though NF2-associated schwannomas may exhibit a variety of unusual features. This laryngeal schwannoma from an NF2 patient shows a multi-nodular \"plexiform\" growth pattern. NF2-associated schwannomas are often polyclonal masses, arising from multiple distinct tumorlets along the course of a peripheral nerve which coalesce into a larger mass, with each nodule of the plexiform tumor potentially representing a distinct neoplastic clone (2).", "Zoom": 0.519, "Pan": [0.65, 0.45], "Overlay": {"x": 0.0, "y": 0.0, "width": 1.408, "height": 0.997}}, {"Name": "Antoni A Histology", "Group": "H&E", "Description": "Schwannomas typically exhibit varying proportion of two basic histologic patterns.
