    - Name: Schwannoma
      Group: H&E
      Description: Schwannomas are proliferations of neoplastic cells which exhibit histologic, ultrastructural, and molecular similarities to the Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system (1). Schwannomas are typically benign slow-growing tumors characterized by a well-circumscribed population of spindled cells with clear or amphophilic cytoplasm, though NF2-associated schwannomas may exhibit a variety of unusual features. This laryngeal schwannoma from an NF2 patient shows a multi-nodular "plexiform" growth pattern. NF2-associated schwannomas are often polyclonal masses, arising from multiple distinct tumorlets along the course of a peripheral nerve which coalesce into a larger mass, with each nodule of the plexiform tumor potentially representing a distinct neoplastic clone (2).

    - Name: Antoni A Histology
      Group: H&E
      Description: Schwannomas typically exhibit varying proportion of two basic histologic patterns. Antoni A regions are more cellular regions consisting of densely packed spindle cells with plump elongate nuclei with tapering ends (a characteristic feature of nerve sheath tumors). Focal nuclear pallisading is a characteristic feature of schwannomas, and eosinophilic process-rich anuclear regions interposed with palisading nuclei may produce pathognomonic Verocay bodies.

    - Name: Antoni B Histology
      Group: H&E
      Description: Schwannomas typically exhibit varying proportion of two basic histologic patterns. Antoni B regions are less cellular and often exhibit smaller rounder nuclei with indistinct processes, a more collagenized or myxoid extracellular matrix, and variable lipidization. Verocay bodies are typically not present in Antoni B regions. There is often a sharp delineation between Antoni A and B regions within the tumor. Antoni B histology likely corresponds with more hyperintense regions on T2-weighted MRI sequences, due to the lower cellularity of these regions.

    - Name: Multinodular Architecture
      Group: H&E
      Description: NF2-associated schwannomas may exhibit unusual growth patterns, including a multinodular architecture as is observed in this tumor. Such architecture likely represents the polyclonal nature of the mass, with each nodule potentially representing a distinct neoplastic clone (2).

      Description: NF2-associated schwannomas may exhibit unusual growth patterns, including a multinodular whorled architecture as is observed in this tumor. Such architecture likely represents the multi-nodular polyclonal nature of the mass, with each whorl or nodule potentially representing a distinct neoplastic clone (2).

    - Name: Verocay Bodies
      Group: H&E
      Description:  Focal nuclear pallisading is a characteristic feature of schwannomas, typically in Antoni A regions, and eosinophilic process-rich anuclear regions interposed with palisading nuclei may produce pathognomonic structures known as Verocay bodies. Verocay bodies are named after the Uruguayan pathologist Jos√© Juan Verocay, who was among the first to describe the phenomenon.

    - Name: Degenerative Changes (Vacuolization/Microcystic Changes)
      Group: H&E
      Description: Schwannomas frequently exhibit a variety of degenerative changes including focal microcystic changes and vacuolization of tumor cells. These changes may be related to vascular abnormalities and hyalinization resulting in focal ischemia and/or hemorrhage.
