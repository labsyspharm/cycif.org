    - Name: Schwannoma
      Group: H&E
      Description: Schwannomas are proliferations of neoplastic cells which exhibit histologic, ultrastructural, and molecular similarities to the Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system (1). Schwannomas are typically benign slow-growing tumors characterized by a well-circumscribed population of spindled cells with clear or amphophilic cytoplasm, though NF2-associated schwannomas may exhibit a variety of unusual features. This laryngeal schwannoma from an NF2 patient shows a multi-nodular "plexiform" growth pattern. NF2-associated schwannomas are often polyclonal masses, arising from multiple distinct tumorlets along the course of a peripheral nerve which coalesce into a larger mass, with each nodule of the plexiform tumor potentially representing a distinct neoplastic clone (2).

    - Name: Antoni A Histology
      Group: H&E
      Description: Schwannomas typically exhibit varying proportion of two basic histologic patterns. Antoni A regions are more cellular regions consisting of densely packed spindle cells with plump elongate nuclei with tapering ends (a characteristic feature of nerve sheath tumors). Focal nuclear pallisading is a characteristic feature of schwannomas, and eosinophilic process-rich anuclear regions interposed with palisading nuclei may produce pathognomonic Verocay bodies. This lesion consists essentially entirely of Antoni A regions with minimal Antoni B histology.

    - Name: Antoni B Histology
      Group: H&E
      Description: Schwannomas typically exhibit varying proportion of two basic histologic patterns. Antoni B regions are less cellular and often exhibit smaller rounder nuclei with indistinct processes, a more collagenized or myxoid extracellular matrix, and variable lipidization. Verocay bodies are typically not present in Antoni B regions. There is often a sharp delineation between Antoni A and B regions within the tumor. Antoni B histology likely corresponds with more hyperintense regions on T2-weighted MRI sequences, due to the lower cellularity of these regions. This lesion exhibits minimal Antoni B histology.

    - Name: Multi-nodular Architecture
      Group: H&E
      Description: NF2-associated schwannomas may exhibit unusual growth patterns, including a multi-nodular architecture as is observed in this tumor. Such architecture likely represents the polyclonal nature of the mass, with each nodule potentially representing a distinct neoplastic clone (2). While a single lesion was noted clinically in this patient, histologic examination showed that the lesion was in fact a multi-nodular collection of intraneural and perineural masses with a plexiform architecture.

    - Name: Verocay Bodies
      Group: H&E
      Description:  Focal nuclear pallisading is a characteristic feature of schwannomas, typically in Antoni A regions, and eosinophilic process-rich anuclear regions interposed with palisading nuclei may produce pathognomonic structures known as Verocay bodies. Verocay bodies are named after the Uruguayan pathologist Jos√© Juan Verocay, who was among the first to describe the phenomenon.

    - Name: Intraneural Infiltration
      Group: H&E
      Description: NF2-associated schwannomas frequently exhibit unusual growth patterns including intraneural infiltration. This resection of a digital schwannoma from an NF2 patient shows a multi-nodular perineural and intraneural collection of neoplastic cells arranged in a plexiform pattern along segments of peripheral nerve. The biological basis for these differences in behavior compared to sporadic schwannomas is not well understood, as sporadic tumors also frequently exhibit loss of the NF2 gene.

    - Name: Perineural Growth
      Group: H&E
      Description: Both sporadic and NF2-associated schwannomas are typically associated with peripheral nerves. However, whereas sporadic schwannomas typically form an expansile solitary mass, NF2-associated schwannomas may exhibit a variety of unusual growth patterns. This lesion shows extensive perineural growth of neoplastic schwannoma cells along nearly peripheral nerve segment of the involved region.
