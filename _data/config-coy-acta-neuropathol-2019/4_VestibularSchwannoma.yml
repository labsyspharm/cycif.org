    - Name: Schwannoma
      Group: H&E
      Description: Schwannomas are proliferations of neoplastic cells which exhibit histologic, ultrastructural, and molecular similarities to the Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system (1). Schwannomas are typically benign slow-growing tumors characterized by a well-circumscribed population of spindled cells with clear or amphophilic cytoplasm, though NF2-associated schwannomas may exhibit a variety of unusual features. Development of bilateral vestibular schwannomas is a pathognomonic feature of NF2. The vestibular schwannomas of NF2 are typically multinodular plexiform masses arising from multiple origins along the superior and vestibular branches of the vestibulocochlear nerve (CNVIII) (2). NF2-associated vestibular schwannomas have a higher risk of recurrence than sporadic vestibular schwannomas, but no significantly increased risk of malignant progression unless treated with radiation (3).

    - Name: Antoni A Histology
      Group: H&E
      Description: Schwannomas typically exhibit varying proportion of two basic histologic patterns. Antoni A regions are more cellular regions consisting of densely packed spindle cells with plump elongate nuclei with tapering ends (a characteristic feature of nerve sheath tumors). Focal nuclear pallisading is a characteristic feature of schwannomas, and eosinophilic process-rich anuclear regions interposed with palisading nuclei may produce pathognomonic Verocay bodies. The tumor shown consists almost entirely of Antoni A histology, but shows only subtle palisading and Verocay bodies. NF2-associated vestibular schwannomas more commonly show a predominance of cellular Antoni A pattern, and may show unusual features such as whorled growth and a multilobular appearance, which likely correlates with the plexiform multinodular origin of NF2-associated masses (2), though these features are not prominent in this case.

    - Name: Antoni B Histology
      Group: H&E
      Description: Schwannomas typically exhibit varying proportion of two basic histologic patterns. Antoni B regions are less cellular and often exhibit smaller rounder nuclei with indistinct processes, a more collagenized or myxoid extracellular matrix, and variable lipidization. Verocay bodies are typically not present in Antoni B regions. There is often a sharp delineation between Antoni A and B regions within the tumor. This tumor was almost entirely composed of Antoni A histology, as is often seen in NF2-associated vestibular schwannomas. Antoni B histology likely corresponds with more hyperintense regions on T2-weighted MRI sequences, due to the lower cellularity of these regions.

    - Name: Perivascular Hyalinization
      Group: H&E
      Description: Schwannomas of all anatomic sites characteristically exhibit dense peri-vascular fibrosis (hyalinization). The etiology of this change is not well understood, but may be related to elevated expression of VEGF by the tumor cells (4). Identification of this feature may be useful in diagnosis of schwannomas with unusual histologic features. The vascular changes in schwannomas may result in obliteration of vessels and focal hemorrhage, infarction, and/or microcystic changes. Peri-vascular hyalinization was not prominent in this case, though it was present focally.

    - Name: Degenerative Changes (Calcifications)
      Group: H&E
      Description: Schwannomas frequently exhibit a variety of degenerative changes including calcifications. These changes may be related to vascular abnormalities resulting in focal ischemia and/or hemorrhage.

    - Name: Peripheral Nerve
      Group: H&E
      Description: Surgical management of vestibular schwannomas is typically focused on maximal preservation of neurologic function, including the branches of the vestibulocochlear nerve (CNVIII). However, in some cases resection of some peripheral nerve segments may be unavoidable, as in this case of an NF2 patient with a large complex vestibular schwannoma resection. The neoplastic cells can be seen surrounding and infiltrating a segment of peripheral nerve.
