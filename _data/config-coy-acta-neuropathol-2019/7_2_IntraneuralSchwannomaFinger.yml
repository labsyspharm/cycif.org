    - Name: Schwannoma
      Group: H&E
      Description: Schwannomas are proliferations of neoplastic cells which exhibit histologic, ultrastructural, and molecular similarities to the Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system (1). Schwannomas are typically benign slow-growing tumors characterized by a well-circumscribed population of spindled cells with clear or amphophilic cytoplasm, though NF2-associated schwannomas may exhibit a variety of unusual features. This digital schwannoma from an NF2 patient shows infiltrative growth within a peripheral nerve.

    - Name: Antoni A Histology
      Group: H&E
      Description: Schwannomas typically exhibit varying proportion of two basic histologic patterns. Antoni A regions are more cellular regions consisting of densely packed spindle cells with plump elongate nuclei with tapering ends (a characteristic feature of nerve sheath tumors). Focal nuclear pallisading is a characteristic feature of schwannomas, and eosinophilic process-rich anuclear regions interposed with palisading nuclei may produce pathognomonic Verocay bodies. This lesion consists essentially entirely of Antoni A regions with minimal Antoni B histology.

    - Name: Antoni B Histology
      Group: H&E
      Description: Schwannomas typically exhibit varying proportion of two basic histologic patterns. Antoni B regions are less cellular and often exhibit smaller rounder nuclei with indistinct processes, a more collagenized or myxoid extracellular matrix, and variable lipidization. Verocay bodies are typically not present in Antoni B regions. There is often a sharp delineation between Antoni A and B regions within the tumor. Antoni B histology likely corresponds with more hyperintense regions on T2-weighted MRI sequences, due to the lower cellularity of these regions. This lesion exhibits minimal Antoni B histology.

    - Name: Intraneural Infiltration
      Group: H&E
      Description: NF2-associated schwannomas frequently exhibit unusual growth patterns including intraneural infiltration. This resection of a digital schwannoma from an NF2 patient shows intraneural infiltration of neoplastic cells within a peripheral nerve, with more normal peripheral nerve segments at the top of the field, and infiltrating schwannoma inferiorly. The biological basis for these differences in behavior compared to sporadic schwannomas is not well understood, as sporadic tumors also frequently exhibit loss of the NF2 gene.
