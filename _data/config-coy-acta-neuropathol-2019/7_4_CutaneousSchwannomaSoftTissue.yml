      Group: H&E
      Description: Schwannomas are proliferations of neoplastic cells which exhibit histologic, ultrastructural, and molecular similarities to the Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system (1). Schwannomas are typically benign slow-growing tumors characterized by a well-circumscribed population of spindled cells with clear or amphophilic cytoplasm, though NF2-associated schwannomas may exhibit a variety of unusual features. NF2 patient frequently develop plaque-like cutaneous schwannomas in which neoplastic cells expand peripheral nerves and infiltrate the adjacent dermis and subcutis surrounding adnexal structures such as hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and eccrine glands. Such lesions are not typically encountered in the sporadic setting or schwannomatosis (2).

    - Name: Intraneural Infiltration
      Group: H&E
      Description: NF2-associated schwannomas frequently exhibit unusual growth patterns including intraneural infiltration. In addition to dermal infiltration, this resection of a cutaneous plaque-like schwannoma from an NF2 patient shows intraneural infiltration of neoplastic cells within a peripheral nerve.
