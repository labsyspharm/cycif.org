        At low magnification, the epicardial fat is seen on one side of the section 
        and papillary muscles are present on the opposite side which is the left ventricle lumen. 
        One of the papillary muscles has peripheral pallor and central hypereosinophilia.

    - Name: Papillary Muscle with Multiple Infarcts
      Group: H&E
      Description: |
        There are three notable features in this muscle. 
        
        One is a region of scarring that is characterized by collagen deposition resulting 
        in a more remote infarct. 
        
        A second region has numerous neutrophils within the interstitial space between 
        the slightly hypereosinophilic myocytes. Acute inflammation is a feature that is 
        characteristic of an acute myocardial infarction (approximately 1-2 days).
        
        Third, peripherally, there is a layer of 5-8 myocytes that are viable but vacuolated. 
        These myocytes are alive because of their proximity to the ventricular lumen where 
        the blood pumping through the heart provides sufficiently for the metabolic needs so 
        as to prevent infarction and death of those peripherally located cells. 
        
        Often, when there is infarction of the papillary muscles of the left ventricle which 
        anchor the mitral valve leaflets via the chordae tendineae, there is mitral valve 
        dysfunction and prominent regurgitation that can result in rapid back flow of blood 
        down the low hemodynamic pressure of the left atrium, and the left veins into the lung. 
        The result is flash pulmonary edema with a rapid accumulation of fluid in the pulmonary 
        interstitium and emergent respiratory distress.

    - Name: Late Acute Myocardial Infarction (~ 5 days)
      Group: H&E
      Description: |
        High magnification view of a region of late acute myocardial infarction 
        (approximately 5 days) showing mononuclear cells in the interstitial space. 
        
        There is a myocyte with two nuclei (binucleated). Binucleation is a normal 
        feature of myocytes when present in up to 10% of myocytes. The number of 
        myocytes with binucleation increases as part of a reparative response to 
        stressors such as volume overload or hypertension. Some species have frequent 
        multi-nucleation with 5-10 nuclei per myocyte. 
        
        Adjacent to the nuclei within the myocytes, are yellow brown colored dots 
        which are lysosomes containing lipids damaged by peroxidation and oxidative 
        stress. These structures are referred to as lipofuscin (thought of as a 
        marker of ‘wear and tear’). 
        
        An intercalated disc is present, a normal structure that permits myocardium 
        to function as a single syncytial unit.
