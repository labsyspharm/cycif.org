      Description: |
        The first organ to form during fetal development, the heart 
        is responsible for pumping blood through the circulatory system
        to supply oxygen to all cells of the body. In humans, the heart is 
        located in the chest cavity between the lungs and sits in a fuild-filled sac
        called the pericardium which serves to protect this vital organ.

        The heart wall is comprised of three layers`:` the 
        1) epicardium, 2) myocardium, and the 3) endocardium.

        The epicardium is the outer most layer and is contiguous with the visceral
        layer of the pericardium. It is composed primarily of adipose tissue, connective 
        tissue including elastic fibers, and mesothelium, which secrete pericardial fluid 
        to help lubricate the heart and reduce friction as it expands in volume.
        The epicardium also contains coronary blood vessels that supply blood to the heart wall.

        The middle layer, or the myocardium, is composed of cardiac muscle 
        fibers (cardiomyocytes) that generate the contractile force 
        needed to pump blood. These contractions are signaled by the peripheral 
        nervous system and synchronized by Purkinje fibers. The myocardium 
        is the thickest layer of the heart wall, with its thickness varying
        in different parts of the heart. The myocardium of the left ventricle
        is the thickest as this ventricle is responsible for generating 
        enough power to pump blood through the aorta to the rest of the body. 
        On average, an adult heart pumps ~6000-75000 liters of blood daily.

        The endocardium is the innermost layer of the heart wall. It lines the 
        inside of chambers and the valves with a simple squamous epithelium, 
        or a single layer of flat cells. This type of epithelium enables rapid 
        diffusion of small molecules.

        In this view of the lateral left ventricle wall, epicardial fat is seen on one 
        side of the section and papillary muscles present on the opposite side which 
        is the left ventricle lumen.

    - Name: Papillary Muscle
      Group: H&E
      Description: |
        The ventricles of the heart contain papillary muscles that attach to 
        atrioventricular valves and contract to prevent inversion of the valves 
        and backflow of blood during systole.

        In the center of one of the papillary muscles is a region of acute ischemia 
        with mildly increased eosinophilia (approximately 12-24 hours). 
        
        Peripherally, there is a layer of 5-8 myocytes that are viable but vacuolated. 
        These myocytes are alive because of their proximity to the ventricular lumen 
        where the blood pumping through the heart provides for the metabolic needs so 
        as to prevent infarction and death of those peripherally located cells. 
        
        Often, when there is infarction of the papillary muscles of the left ventricle 
        which anchor the mitral valve leaflets via the chordae tendineae, there is 
        mitral valve dysfunction and prominent regurgitation that can result in rapid 
        back flow of blood down the low hemodynamic pressure of the left atrium, and 
        the left veins into the lung. The result is flash pulmonary edema with a rapid 
        accumulation of fluid in the pulmonary interstitium and emergent respiratory distress.
