    Multiplexed 3D atlas of state transitions and immune interactions in colorectal cancer (Minerva Abstract)
  Header: |
    Advanced solid cancers are complex assemblies of cancer, immune and stromal cells that invade adjacent tissue. Here we use multiplexed tissue imaging, spatial statistics, and machine learning to identify cell states underlying morphological features of known prognostic significance in colorectal cancer. We find that the necessary spatial analysis requires extended tumor domains, not tissue microarrays or small view-fields. When this condition is met, the data reveal frequent transitions between histological archetypes (tumor grades and morphologies) correlated with molecular gradients. At tumor invasive margins, where tumor, normal, and immune cells compete, localized features in 2D such as tumor buds and mucin pools are seen in 3D to be large connected structures having continuously varying molecular properties. Immunosuppressive cell-cell interactions also exhibit graded variation in type and frequency. Thus, whereas scRNA-Seq emphasizes discrete changes in tumor state, whole-specimen imaging reveals the presence of multi-scale spatial gradients analogous to those in developing tissues.

      Description: |
        The resected tumor and adjacent normal tissue in CRC1 is from the cecum of a 69-year old male; pathology revealed a poorly differentiated stage IIIB adenocarcinoma (pT3N1bM0) (Weiser, 2018) with microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and a BRAFV600E (c.1799T>A) mutation. The tumor had an extended front invading into underlying muscle (muscularis propria) and connective tissue giving rise to a "budding margin" (A, red-dotted line) adjacent to normal colon epithelium, a "mucinous margin" in the middle of the specimen (B, blue-dotted line), and a deep "pushing margin" (C, gray-dotted line)

        Using the MCMICRO software pipeline (Schapiro et al., 2021), images were segmented, fluorescence intensities quantified on a per-cell basis, and cell types assigned using lineage-specific marker expression; a total of ~5 x 10<sup>7</sup> cells were successfully identified in a tissue volume of 1.2 x 10<sup>11</sup> µm<sup>3</sup>. Cells are labeled above by whether their type belongs to a tumor, stroma, or immune category. Overlaying the image with cell type calling allows for analysis of different spatial features and cell-cell interactions in various tumor regions.

      Name: Tumor buds 1
      Description: |
        Zooming into one of the TLS near the tumor and normal tissue junction, we notice small clusters of tumor cells, known as “tumor buds”. For diagnostic purposes, tumor buds are defined as clusters of ≤4 tumor cells along the invasive front (Lugli et al., 2017b), and less commonly the non-marginal "internal" stroma of the tumor mass (Lugli et al., 2011). Tumor buds are thought to associate with tumor metastasis as well as other aggressive phenotypes, but their relationship with immunosurveillance is not fully understood.

      Name: Tumor buds 2
      Description: |
        In solid tumors, an EMT-like transition at the invasive front gives rise to small clusters of “dedifferentiated” tumor buds likely involved in metastatic dissemination (Zlobec and Lugli, 2010). Lower `E-cadherin` expression is observed in the tumor buds. They also seem to be evading immunosurveillance, e.g. of the nearby `CD8`<sup>+</sup> effector T cells.

      Description: |
        Highly multiplexed CyCIF data allow further dissection of cells into different subtypes, including 3 tumor/epi types, 3 stroma cell types and 15 different immune subpopulations. Thus, we can enumerate all these cell types in different tumor regions, and evaluate compositions and potential cell-cell interactions with spatial context. 
        
        For example, we observe an enrichment of immunosuppression subtypes (e.g. T<sub>reg</sub>, PD-L1 macrophage and `PD-1`<sup>+</sup> cells) in close-proximity of budding tumor.

      Description: |
        Multiple immunosuppressive interactions have been described in colorectal cancer involving ingress of Tregs and expression of checkpoint proteins on both tumor and immune cells.  The established connection between tumor budding, metastasis and disease recurrence is likely to reflect the presence of tumor cells undergoing EMT (and developing the ability to disseminate) as well as a permissive and immunosuppressive environment.

      Name: Predicting tumor morphology using expression data 1
      Description: |
        A kNN classifier was trained to predict other archetypal features of tumor morphology (glandular, solid, mucinous), using only the CyCIF marker expression of individual epithelial cells. The classifier outputs the probability of a cell belonging to a region of each morphological archetype, and the relative proportion of each archetype is represented by hue.

      Name: Predicting tumor morphology using expression data 2 - validation using adjacent H&E section
      Description: |
        The classifier predicts various transition regions between the three tumor morphologies. For example, here, the classifier expects the left-region to be mucinous (blue), transitioning to glandular (red) in the center, and patches of solid (green) towards the top. The adjacent H&E section supports the classifier predictions: contiguous patches of blue cells are indeed in close proximity to mucin, groups of red cells are often part of gland-like structures, while contiguous patches of green cells form solid sheets. Intermediate hues and mixed-color patches of cells suggest intermediate morphologies along a transition gradient.

      Description: |
        Advanced solid cancers are complex assemblies of cancer, immune and stromal cells that invade adjacent tissue. Here we use multiplexed tissue imaging, spatial statistics, and machine learning to identify cell states underlying morphological features of known prognostic significance in colorectal cancer. We find that the necessary spatial analysis requires extended tumor domains, not tissue microarrays or small view-fields. When this condition is met, the data reveal frequent transitions between histological archetypes (tumor grades and morphologies) correlated with molecular gradients. At tumor invasive margins, where tumor, normal, and immune cells compete, localized features in 2D such as tumor buds and mucin pools are seen in 3D to be large connected structures having continuously varying molecular properties. Immunosuppressive cell-cell interactions also exhibit graded variation in type and frequency. Thus, whereas scRNA-Seq emphasizes discrete changes in tumor state, whole-specimen imaging reveals the presence of multi-scale spatial gradients analogous to those in developing tissues.
