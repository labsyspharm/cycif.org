The sample was systematically analyzed via histopathologic examination by a pathologist, single cell segmentation and classification of cell-states by marker expression, and machine learning-based approaches to predict cell-state transitions and spatial relationships at both single cell and tissue-level resolutions. These analyses revealed spatially-organized molecular and morphologic transitions and spatial interactions occurring between diverse cell populations in distinct tumor microenvironments.

Histologically, the mucosa consists of a surface columnar epithelium bounded by basement membrane and underlying stroma which is densely populated by chronic inflammatory cells including lymphocytes, monocytic cells, and eosinophils with only rare neutrophils in the resting state (see immune populations marker set). The epithelium exhibits regular invaginations into the stroma with a circumferential parallel array of tubular epithelial \"crypts\" which are arrayed similar to a rack of test tubes, with openings into the bowl lumen. In this section, crypts can be seen in cross-section and in longitudinal profile. The epithelium consists of a mixture of cell types, including prominent mucinous goblet cells which exhibit a clear cytoplasm in standard H&E sections (resulting from a washing out of the mucinous contents during tissue processing), absorptive cells which exhibit a more eosinophilic cytoplasm, and more rarely interspersed neuroendocrine cells. The mucinous goblet cells are more prominent in the colorectum than in the small bowel. The deep aspect of the crypts is hypothesized to harbor stem-like progenitor cells which intermittently generate highly proliferative progenitor cells that terminal differentiate as they approach the luminal surface to continuously regenerate and replace the colorectal epithelial surface. Indeed, examination of the crypts with proliferation markers such as PCNA or Ki-67 shows a much higher degree of cell cycle activity in the deep aspects of the crypts (see proliferation marker set). \n\nMuscularis mucosa - The muscularis mucosa is a thin band of smooth muscle cells which delimits the deep edge of the mucosal compartment. The muscularis mucosa can be identified in this section as a brightly eosinophilic band of spindled cells at the deep surface of the mucosa on H&E. In tumor resections, invasion of atypical cells through the muscularis mucosa into the submucosa represents an important event, as this behavior is the definitive finding defining transition from an \"in situ\" carcinoma with essentially no metastatic risk (pTis), to an \"invasive\" carcinoma with associated increased risk of local or distant metastatic spread (pT1) [AJCC 8th Edition]. The muscularis mucosa can be highlighted here by observing the aSMA, desmin, or collagen channels in the Tissue Structure or Stroma marker sets, respectively. \n\nSubmucosa - The submucosa is a loose collagenous connective tissue structure interposed between the muscularis mucosa and muscularis propria. The submucosa contains a rich bed of lymphatic and blood vessels, and lymphovascular invasion (LVI) is often identified at this level if present. Involvement of the submucosa by tumor defines frank invasion in the colorectum (pT1). \n\nMuscularis propria - The muscularis propria is the thick smooth muscular wall of the bowel which is arranged into several distinct layer, principally including the longitudinal and circumferential layers in the colorectum (these can be seen here as the two distinct layers of smooth muscle oriented in different directions on H&E).  The muscularis regulates digestion by controlling peristalsis and moevement of the bowel wall. Invasion of an invasive adenocarcinoma into the muscularis propria represents a more advanced stage of invasion (pT2) with a higher risk of recurrence and metastatic spread (pT2). The muscularis mucosa can be highlighted here by observing the aSMA, desmin, or collagen channels in the Tissue Structure or Stroma marker sets, respectively. \n\nSubserosa - The subserosa is the loose fibroadipose connective tissue associated with the bowl wall which lies deep to the muscularis propria. Invasion of tumor into the subserosal soft tissue denotes a further progression of stage with increased risk of recurrence and metastatis (pT3). \n\nSerosa - The serosa is the final layer of the bowel wall. In the peritoneal cavity it is lined by a single layer of cuboidal mesothelial cells. Mesothelial cells are specialized epithelial cells and may sometimes cause confusion with invasive tumor when they undergo hyperplasia and reactive changes and exhibit clusters of cells with frond-like papillary architecture; however, they may be differentiated from other epithelial tumor cells by molecular markers including the absence of e-cadherin expression, and expression of mesothelial cell markers such as WT1 and calretinin (see Tissue Structure and E-Cadherin marker sets). In the retroperitoneum (some aspects of the right colon including the cecum), the serosal surface is bounded by a fibrous adventitial layer. Invasion of tumor through the serosal surface into the peritoneal cavity or adjacent structures represents the highest grade of local invasion, with the greatest risk of recurrence and metastatic spread (pT4). This section of bowel exhibits some hyperplasia of the mesothelial cell layer, giving it a more complex tufted appearance, but these cells may be confirmed as mesothelial and not surface involvement by morphologic features and marker expression (see E-cadherin marker set).\n\nIn this case, the tumor is present on the bottom aspect of the frame, while the serosal surface is present at the superior aspect. The bowel wall has been cut in an oblique plane, accounting for the convoluted appearance of the muscularis and serosa. \n\nThe tumor exhibits an exophytic (extending into the bowel lumen) growth pattern on the right-hand side of the field, with prominent mucinous pools generated by mucinous tumor cells present inferiorly extending as deeply as the muscularia propria. The tumor exhibits a moderately differentiated glandular appearance on the left-hand and bottom aspects of the field, while on the right side of the field in the exophytic region of tumor there are intermixed regions with a more poorly differentiated solid sheet-like architecture, with focal signet ring cell features and tumor budding. \n\nCollections of immune cells are present associated with the tumor, in addition to the normal immune complement of the bowel mucosa (see immune marker panels, and subsequent discussion).", "Group": "Histology", "Masks": [], "Name": "Tissue Organization [Histology]", "Overlays": [], "Pan": [0.4819137168141593, 0.5], "Zoom": 0.5183593749999998}, {"ActiveMasks": [], "Arrows": [{"Angle": 300, "HideArrow": false, "Point": [0.8157494364825845, 0.31650339110776177], "Text": "Mucosa"}, {"Angle": 300, "HideArrow": false, "Point": [0.7878669948849958, 0.2690278824415975], "Text": "Muscularis Mucosa"}, {"Angle": 300, "HideArrow": false, "Point": [0.7456665427372943, 0.20497362471740754], "Text": "Submucosa"}, {"Angle": 300, "HideArrow": false, "Point": [0.6416725713733152, 0.15448379804069312], "Text": "Muscularis Propria"}, {"Angle": 300, "HideArrow": false, "Point": [0.5246165552969524, 0.08649418069161852], "Text": "Subserosa"}, {"Angle": 180, "HideArrow": false, "Point": [0.13275521392543776, 0.2606547768567361], "Text": "Serosa"}, {"Angle": 180, "HideArrow": false, "Point": [0.08502851209172757, 0.5537134723268861], "Text": "Invasive Adenocarcinoma, involving Muscularis Propria"}, {"Angle": 180, "HideArrow": false, "Point": [0.1913669530194677, 0.8677049317591895], "Text": "Invasive Adenocarcinoma, involving Submucosa"}, {"Angle": 30, "HideArrow": false, "Point": [0.41827811436921225, 0.9095704596834966], "Text": "Invasive Adenocarcinoma, superficial/luminal surface"}, {"Angle": 30, "HideArrow": false, "Point": [0.27677262998505425, 0.9757179938039018], "Text": "Ulcer Bed"}, {"Angle": 220, "HideArrow": false, "Point": [0.39734535040705876, 0.6458176337603617], "Text": "Invasive Adenocarcinoma, with Mucinous Features"}, {"Angle": 360, "HideArrow": false, "Point": [0.7532023377636694, 0.37871556560328223], "Text": "Invasive Adenocarcinoma, with Signet Ring Cell Features"}, {"Angle": 360, "HideArrow": false, "Point": [0.8564432899763368, 0.5337370103231389], "Text": "Invasive Adenocarcinoma, with Solid Architecture"}, {"Angle": 180, "HideArrow": false, "Point": [0.7187075336454248, 0.5040935676535856], "Text": "Invasive Adenocarcinoma, Tumor Budding Region"}, {"Angle": 60, "HideArrow": true, "Point": [0.8444691886386589, 0.9102403081302853], "Text": "Bowel Lumen"}, {"Angle": 60, "HideArrow": true, "Point": [0.08916907985017969, 0.1001740538275813], "Text": "Peritoneal Cavity"}], "Description": "Multiplexed immunofluorescence (CyCIF) effectively highlights the principle anatomic compartments of the tissue specimen. \n\nStroma  - Alpha smooth muscle actin (ASMA) [Red] - ASMA highlights smooth muscle cells and myofibroblasts.

The muscularis mucosa is identifiable as a prominent band of ASMA-positive smooth muscle cells bounding the mucosal compartment on the upper right of the specimen.

Accordingly, PanCK intensely highlights normal mucosal epithelium, tumor epithelial cells, and mesothelial cells. Normal epithelium and tumor cells also express other epithelial adhesion molecules such as e-cadherin, but this protein is not present in serosal mesothelial cells (see also E-cadherin, NaK ATPase marker sets)\n\nVascular  - CD31 [Green] - CD31 (PECAM-1) is a cell adhesion molecule that is most strongly expressed on endothelial cells, though it may also be expressed by platelets, monocytes, neutrophils, and T cells. In this representation, the fluorescence intensity has been optimized to highlight endothelial cells, which line the luminal surface of all vascular structures. \n\nImmune - CD45 [Yellow] - CD45 (PTPRC) encodes a surface membrane protein tyrosine phosphatase that is expressed by nearly all hematolymphoid cell populations, and therefore represents an excellent \"pan-immune\" tissue marker.

Tumor budding was first conceptually described in 1949 by Imai et al. in their classification of gastric carcinomas [2], and subsequently shown to correlate with clinical outcome in a variety of solid cancers including for colorectal carcinomas, though the concept was only minimally explored until the 1980s [3]. Since that period, a number of studies have explored the possibility of using tumor budding as a novel tumor classifier, and systematic meta-analyses show that tumor budding significantly correlates with poor outcomes in colorectal carcinomas including risk of lymph node metastases, local recurrence, distant metastases, and cancer-related death, independently of tumor TNM stage [4]. The related concept of poorly differentiated clusters (PDCs) refers to similar collections of cells at the invasive front that have lost glandular differentiation, but which form larger clusters and do not meet the definition of tumor budding (>=5 cells) [5]. \n\nPathologic examination of the CRC01 tissue specimen revealed a region of prominent tumor budding near the invasive front of the tumor. Tumor budding cells were annotated by a pathologists using the ITBCC consensus criteria of <=4 cells and were segmented and analyzed for marker expression and neighborhood spatial correlations at a single cell level. Scattered poorly differentiated clusters were also present in the region of tumor budding, and were noted but not included in the training cohort of tumor budding cells. \n\nSingle cell analysis of marker expression in tumor budding cells relative to other tumor cell populations in the main mass (ROI2-6) and normal mucosa (ROI1) showed that these cells exhibit a unique molecular phenotype characterized by reduced expression of characteristic epithelial markers such as E-cadherin and NaK ATPase and reduced proliferative cell cycle activity as assessed by PCNA and Ki-67/MIB-1 staining (highlighted in this field). On the other hand, tumor budding cells at the invasive tumor margin exhibited higher expression of PD-L1 compared to the main tumor mass, indicating that they may suppress local anti-tumor cytotoxic immunity. \n\nInterestingly, these markers exhibited a continuous graded expression profile correlating with tumor cluster size with tumor budding cells representing just one end of a continuous spectrum of molecular differentiation. Larger clusters, including those that would be classified as poorly differentiated clusters (PDCs) also exhibited reduced expression of these markers relative to the main tumor mass, though at an intermediate level to tumor budding cells and the main mass. \n\n3D reconstruction and analysis of tumor budding regions showed that tumor buds in fact rarely represent individual cells or clusters which have completely separated from the main tumor mass, but rather, represent the tips of a contiguous complex network of tendril-like structures connected to the main tumor mass. Poorly differentiated clusters in the region of tumor budding rather than representing distinct tumor nests, instead represent the more proximal aspects of this network. These findings suggest that while tumor budding cells exhibit a migratory molecular program, they have not undergone definitive epithelial-to-mesenchymal differentiation and remain an intrinsic yet specialized epithelial niche of the overall tumor mass. \n\nHere, we highlight tumor budding cells and poorly differentiated clusters (arrows) at the invasive front of the tumor. Tumor budding cells exhibit significantly reduced expression of E-cadherin (green) and PCNA (red) compared to adjacent PDCs or the main tumor mass, while many PDCs exhibit an intermediate expression pattern, though this is more difficult to appreciate qualitatively. \n\n[1] Lugli, A. et al.
