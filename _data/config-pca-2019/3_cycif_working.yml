Red color is MART-1 which highlights the melanoma cells and the tiffany green color is pan-keratin which marks the epidermis. We can see the intact epidermis overlying the tumor cells in left portion of the region, however, the epidermis is missing above melanoma in the ulcerated area on the right side of the region.

        There is no complete normal skin in this specimen. However, we can see the relative "normal" region of skin with sparse melanocyte distribution highlighted by MART-1 in red. The normal distribution of melanocytes should be at the basal layer of the epidermis in between 7-10 keratinocytes. In this particular area, we start to see CD3-positive T cells in white infiltrate.
