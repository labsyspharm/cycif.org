    - Name: Invasive melanoma with brisk TILs
      Group: Architecure panel
      Description: >-
        This area shows superficially invasive
        melanoma (Clark Level II) with a brisk
        response of `CD3D`-positive T cells at
        the tumor-stroma interface with
        scattered infiltrating T cells. The
        CD4:CD8 ratio is approximately 1:1 with
        condensation of predominantly
        CD8a-positive T cells at the
        tumor-stroma interface; FOX3P-positive T
        regulatory cells are scattered within
        the dermis. In this instance, PD-L1
        expression appears to be limited to the
        CD4-positive T cell and CD163-positive
        histiocytes populations with both
        CD8a-positive T cells and melanoma cells
        showing absence of expression.

      Description: >-
        Here we see melanoma in situ with a
        brisk response of CD3-positive T cells
        within the underlying papillary dermis
        but without prominent condensation at
        the dermo-epidermal junction and with
        only scattered exocytosis of T cells
        into the epidermis. Langerhans cells are
        abundant within the lesion. The CD4:CD8
        ratio is approximately 1:1 with even
        dispersion of both populations within
        the dermis; FOX3P-positive T regulatory
        cells are also present and scattered.
        Here, PD-L1 expression is again most
        prominent on dermal histiocytes and
        CD4-positive T cells, with CD8a-positive
        T cells and melanoma cells showing
        relatively dim or absent expression.
