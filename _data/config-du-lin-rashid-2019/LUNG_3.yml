    An interactive tour of squamous cell lung cancer.
    
    The tissue consists of a primary lung tumor and adjacent normal lung epithelium surgically resected from a 44 year old female patient.
    
    Multiplexed images of immune markers were generated using tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence (t-CyCIF) with a 40X/0.6NA objective.
    
    Note that the immunofluorescence signal for some markers (Keratin, IBA1, etc.) in this dataset are overexposured.

      Description: |
        Programmed Death Ligand 1 (`PD-L1`), also known as cluster of differentiation 274 (CD274), 
        is a target of immunotherapeutics. It is expressed in tumor cells (`Keratin`) 
        as well as in some macrophages (`IBA1`). `PD-L1` inactivates T-cells 
        and prevents immune surveillance of the tumors by binding to the PD-1 receptor on T-cells. 
        Thus, one approach to immunotherapy is to block `PD-L1` expression.

        In this lung cancer, we found a rare, or low frequency, immune population`:` CD8+/FOXP3+ T cells. 
        
        Traditionally, expression of `FOXP3` has been observed in `CD4` expressing cells,
        indicating a regulatory T cell phenotype. However, single-cell analysis of multiple markers 
        revealed a population of `CD8` expressing T cells that also expresses `FOXP3`. 
        
        The frequency of this population is very low (0.66% of immune cells) in this tumor. 
        
        This rare population of `CD8` and `FOXP3` expressing cells in addition to the more characterized 
        population of `CD4` and `FOXP3` expressing cells are both enriched in the tumor region.

        Another rare, or low frequency, population present in the tumor 
        is `PD-1`+/`LAG3`+ double positive T cells. Both of these markers are
        immune checkpoint receptors expressed on T cells and are therefore 
        targets of immunotherapies.

        Some of these `PD-1`+/`LAG3`+ double positive cells express `CD4` 
        whereas others express `CD8`.

        The frequency of these populations is very low. `CD8`+/`PD-1`+/`LAG3`+ 
        cells comprise only 1% of immune cells whereas `CD4`+/`PD-1`+/`LAG3`+ 
        cells comprise an even smaller proportion, ~0.1% of immune cells.

        Both populations are enriched in the tumor region, with `CD8`+/`PD-1`+/`LAG3`++ cells
        having a 14-fold greater abundance in the tumor region versus the stromal region
        and `CD4`+/`PD-1`+/`LAG3`+ cells being present exclusively in the tumor region.

      Description: |
        Many macrophages are present in both the tumor and stromal regions of this lung tissue. 
        
        A subtype of macrophages or dendritic cells are detected using `IBA1`. 
        Dendritic cells typically process antigens and present it on their cell surface to T cells, 
        acting as an intermediary between the innate and adaptive immune systems.
        
        Another macrophage marker, `CD163`, can be seen expressed on the surface of
        macrophages or monocytes. `CD163` expressing cells are typically involved
        in endocytosis and clearance of hemoglobin complexes.

        Multiplexed imaging reveals the diversity and dynamic states of macrophages, 
        with some cells showing co-expression of `IBA1` and `CD163`.

        Other subtypes of macrophages include CD68 expressing macrophages which are involved in macrophage homing, 
        CD11B expressing macrophages which are involved in adheisive interactions, 
        and CD14 expressing macrophages which mediate innate immune responses. 

        Interestingly, CD68 and CD11B expressing macrophages are concentrated in the tumor region, 
        whereas CD14 expressing macropages are spread throughout the tissue.
