    An interactive tour of single-cell data analysis in a squamous cell lung cancer.
    
    The tissue consists of a primary lung tumor and adjacent normal lung epithelium surgically resected from a 44 year old female patient.
    
    Note that the immunofluorescence signal for some markers (Keratin, IBA1, etc.) in this dataset are overexposured.

      Description: |
        Tissue cyclic immunofluorescence (t-CyCIF) was used to generate the fluorescence images.
        
        The RareCyte CyteFinder microscope was used with a 40X/0.6NA objective.

        The images were artifact corrected using the BaSiC tool, stitched and registered using the ASHLAR algorithm, 
        and segmented using ilastik software and MATLAB. Single-cell features were then extracted from these images using HistoCAT software.

      Description: |
        Cells in the image were segmented using object detection method. Here, we used the Ilastik software
        to train a model that classifies pixels into three classes (nucleus, cytoplasm, and background). 
        Probability masks generated by the model were used to perform morphological manipulations and 
        watershed in MATLAB to identify cells. 

        While ~90% of the cells in this tissue are segmented accurately, there are some errors including 
        fusions (undersegmented cells) and fissions (over segmented cells) as shown here.
        Cell segmentation is a critical component of extracting quality single-cell data and 
        can affect the quality of downstream analysis; segmentation is thus an active area of development
        in the image analysis community.

        Pan around the image and toggle the segmentation mask to inspect the accuracy.

        When single cells are clustered based on their expression of `Keratin`, `a-SMA`, and `CD45` 
        using the k-means algorithm, the cells fall into four cardinal clusters `:` 
        1) A cluster of tumor cells with high keratin expression, 
        2) a cluster of stromal cells with high `a-SMA` expression, 
        3) a cluster of immune cells with high `CD45` expression, and 
        4) a cluster of cells with low expression of all three markers.

        enriched in the tumor region.
        
        When the subset of CD45 positive cells was clustered based on expression 
        of CD45, CD3D, CD8A, CD4, CD20, PD1, and FOXP3 using k-means, 
        seven distinct immune cell populations emerged.
        
        The populations are shown in the heat map below, where each row represents 
        a cluster and each column represents an immune marker. 
        The color represents the expression level of each marker.
