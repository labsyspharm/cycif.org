This treatment (decalcification) \nremoves much of the calcium that builds up in the vessel walls which \nwould prevent the microtome blades from cutting. The remaining calcium \ncan be seen as a bluish material. \n\nThe adventitia of the coronary arteries contain small clusters of \ninflammatory cells as well as capillaries and adipose tissue.\n\nThe tunica media is of variable thickness with some areas showing \nmarked thinning and atrophy due to pressure. There is extensive fibrosis \nand calcification which suggests a stable lesion that is not prone \nto undergoing erosion and rupture and ultimately thrombosis. \n\nUnstable plaques tend to have a more significant atheromatous component. \n\nIn tissue sections, atheromatous areas are seen as cleared out spaced. \nThis clearing results from tissue processing methods that gradually \ndehydrate tissues through ascending strengths of alcohol, followed \nby immersion in the organic solvent xylene which removes fats, \nleaving empty spaces. The tissue is then impregnated in paraffin wax \nwhich is allowed to solidify. Sections are taken from the paraffin \nblock using a microtome. These sections are very thin, approximately \n3 to 5 microns in thickness (~ 1/250 of a millimeter in thickness). \nThe tissue section is mounted onto a glass slide and stained with \nhematoxylin and eosin. \n\nPlaques with atheromatous changes are termed vulnerable plaques. \nThese are unstable and prone to undergoing plaque erosion, \nthrombosis and massive myocardial infarction. The term \natherosclerosis originates from the Greek word \"athero\" which means \ngruel and sclerosis which means hard.\n", "Zoom": 0.493, "Pan": [0.772, 0.4496]}, {"Name": "Plaque Rupture", "Group": "H&E", "Description": "This vessel demonstrates an area that has undergone plaque rupture with \nthrombosis followed by recanalization. \n\nThere are scattered macrophages laden with hemosiderin.  \n", "Zoom": 2.1198, "Pan": [0.6777, 0.5593], "Overlay": {"x": 0.5556, "y": 0.4499, "width": 0.2853, "height": 0.2246}, "Arrows": [{"Point": [0.703546346677245, 0.5726055982880182], "Text": "recanalization", "HideArrow": false, "Angle": 60}, {"Point": [0.681190887221734, 0.5610298410916863], "Text": "recanalization", "HideArrow": false, "Angle": 240}, {"Point": [0.6845777161865886, 0.5770789767955489], "Text": "recanalization", "HideArrow": false}, {"Point": [0.6828745597274372, 0.6092520344057655], "Text": "macrophages with hemosiderin", "HideArrow": false, "Angle": 240}, {"Point": [0.6860976078346334, 0.6106044112592685], "Text": "macrophages with hemosiderin", "HideArrow": false}, {"Point": [0.683865319029438, 0.6220674765714554], "Text": "macrophages with hemosiderin", "HideArrow": false}, {"Point": [0.6869321405390434, 0.5396389505766023], "Text": "plaque", "HideArrow": false, "Angle": 240}, {"Point": [0.7622599284491921, 0.4993794570393635], "Text": "calcification", "HideArrow": false, "Angle": 60}, {"Point": [0.6475810504504055, 0.6170507938110269], "Text": "calcification", "HideArrow": false}, {"Point": [0.755883548591806, 0.6171084268313639], "Text": "nerve", "HideArrow": false}, {"Point": [0.7799158552496649, 0.6110426996252611], "Text": "nerve", "HideArrow": false}]}, {"Name": "Stable Plaque", "Group": "H&E", "Description": "Overall, these sections show substantial occlusion but the dense fibrosis \nwith limited atheromatous change is consistent with stable plaques.   \n", "Zoom": 1.8651, "Pan": [0.6027, 0.3526], "Overlay": {"x": 0.4593, "y": 0.2345, "width": 0.3184, "height": 0.2442}, "Arrows": [{"Point": [0.7062222415053794, 0.5783603276125244], "Text": "recanalization", "HideArrow": false, "Angle": 60}, {"Point": [0.6828520270123831, 0.6096011894184986], "Text": "macrophage with hemosiderin", "HideArrow": false, "Angle": 60}, {"Point": [0.6869321405390434, 0.5396389505766023], "Text": "plaque", "HideArrow": false, "Angle": 240}, {"Point": [0.7622599284491921, 0.4993794570393635], "Text": "calcium buildup", "HideArrow": false, "Angle": 60}]}]}]}
