Generally, the wall of the left atrium is ~3-4mm in thickness. \nThe endocardial layer of the left atrium is generally thick with the collagen deposited by \nscattered fibroblasts partly in response to the pressure of blood entering from the pulmonary veins.\n", "Zoom": 0.4542, "Pan": [0.5741, 0.5], "Arrows": [{"Point": [0.27193016757085453, 0.14531343387641257], "Text": "epicardial adipose tissue", "HideArrow": false}, {"Point": [0.6164780165202559, 0.39459114358522], "Text": "intramyocardial adipose tissue", "HideArrow": false}]}, {"Name": "Vasculature", "Group": "H&E", "Description": "This area contains an artery, a vein, and a nerve.\n\nThe artery and vein are filled with red blood cells and both are lined by endothelial cells (tunica intima). \n\nThe artery has a thick muscular wall (tunica media) whereas the vein has a thin muscular wall. \n\nThe adjacent nerve is a branch of the vagus nerve that provides parasympathetic innervation of \nthe heart and innervates the sinoatrial node.\n", "Zoom": 6.4196, "Pan": [0.6307, 0.3375], "Overlay": {"x": 0.5758, "y": 0.3007, "width": 0.1098, "height": 0.0785}, "Arrows": [{"Point": [0.6150123503469498, 0.32019207229763913], "Text": "artery", "HideArrow": false}, {"Point": [0.6194707424700321, 0.35950863588183896], "Text": "vein", "HideArrow": false, "Angle": 180}, {"Point": [0.6387152116346204, 0.3129526602404003], "Text": "nerve", "HideArrow": false}, {"Point": [0.6594855201850044, 0.3455637834809856], "Text": "nerve", "HideArrow": false}, {"Point": [0.6330586801218178, 0.3602260261922217], "Text": "red blood cells", "HideArrow": false}, {"Point": [0.6132393503824658, 0.34649869340033307], "Text": "endothelial cells", "HideArrow": false, "Angle": 240}]}, {"Name": "Myocytes", "Group": "H&E", "Description": "In this high- magnification view of the left atrium, individual myocytes are seen, each \ncontributing to functional syncytium. \n\nThe cross striations of myocytes are readily evident with regularly and equally spaced \nalternating dark and light lines. \n\nThe nuclei of myocytes are generally placed in the middle of the myocyte and are \ngenerally ovoid, often with prominent nucleoli.
