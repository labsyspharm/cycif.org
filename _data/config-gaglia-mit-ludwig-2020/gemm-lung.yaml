  Header: "This story explores the organization of immune cells in a genetically engineered\
    \ mouse model (GEMM) of lung adenocarcinoma. \n\nThe model is driven by a KRas(G12D)\
    \ lox-stop-lox and flox-p53 cassette. Tumors are initiated by intra-tracheal delivery\
    \ of adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase, which causes the constitutive expression\
    \ of mutant KRas and knocks out the tumor suppressor p53. In addition to the tumor\
    \ driving mutation the virus delivery induces the overexpression of the Luciferase\
    \ protein fused with ovalbumin epitope SIINFEKL. The continuous antigen presentation\
    \ drives the accumulation of immune cells nearby and within tumor areas."

      Description: "Each slide contains sections from two lobes of mouse lung (one\
        \ of which is represented within the box). \n\nThe lung cells are loosely\
        \ arranged except for areas where tumors grow. The increased proliferation\
        \ creates nodules of tumors where epithelial cells are densely aggregated.\

      Description: "Together with the two lung lobes each sample contains a spleen\
        \ section from the same mouse. \n\nThe spleen is an internal control used\
        \ for immune marker stains. Both positive and negative controls are fundamental\
        \ to validate antibodies and build reliable marker panels. This ground work\
        \ is the key to investigating biology in situ with sub-cellular resolution.\n\
        \nThe cells of the spleen express CD45 (red), a pan-immune cell marker,\
        \ and lack the lung epithelial marker Nkx2.1 (TTF1: green).\n\nThe spleen is also\
        \ a great control for lymphocyte markers. Toggle the marker panels on the\
        \ right of the screen to see more immune markers and how they segregate within\
        \ the spleen. "

      Description: "Each lung lobe contains multiple tumor nodules. Each tumor is\
        \ thought to be clonal (i.e. to originate from a single transformed cell). \n\
        \nThe nodules are easily recognizable because of the increased cell density,\
        \ as compared to the rest of the lung tissue. Most cells in the nodules are\
        \ epithelial cells marked by Nkx2.1 (TTF1: green), however a lot of nodules\
        \ also contain immune cells (CD45: red) with striking heterogeneity. You\
        \ can see how nearby tumors in the same lung are either massively infiltrated\
        \ with immune cells or lack them completely.\n\nThe lung tissues also\
        \ contain a considerable number of lung-resident macrophages expressing CD11c\
        \ (white) scattered throughout the lung."

      Description: 'Immune cells assemble within tumors forming tightly packed groups,
        consisting mostly if not exclusively of lymphocytes - B cells (CD45R: orange)
        and T cells (CD4: magenta, CD8a: red, FOXP3: cyan).


        How and why do these networks form? Are lymphocytes communicating within these
        structure? Are the network beneficial for mounting an effective immune response
        to the tumor invasion?


        We are in the process of addressing these questions, stay tuned!'
