  title: Spatio-temporal effects of genetic and therapeutic perturbation on the immune micro-environment in murine models of lung and pancreas adenocarcinomas
  description: In a collaboration with Dr. Tyler Jacks at Ludwig MIT, we used t-CyCIF to characterize tumor intrinsic and extrinsic states in genetically engineered cancer models of lung and pancreas samples treated with clinical trial agents such as HSP90 inhibitors, classic cytotoxic agents, and immune checkpoint blockade modifiers. We are interested in understanding the effects of genetic perturbations, for example targeted deletion or over-expression of individual or panels of cancer, and immune-related genes in these samples.
