      Description: "This tissue specimen was resected from a 69-year old white male\
        \ and is a stage IIIB colon adenocarcinoma with a BRAF (V600E) mutation. \n\
        \nThe epithelium is marked by `Keratin` expression and the stroma, which is\
        \ the supportive tissue consisting of blood vessels, connective tissue, and\
        \ smooth muscle cells that line the intestinal wall and aid peristalsis, are\
        \ marked by `aSMA`.\n\nThe tumor cells are of epithelial origin and multiple\
        \ stages of disease progression can be observed in different regions of the\
        \ tissue. \n"

      Description: Fluorescence imaging is a powerful tool that adds fluorescent molecules
        to tissue to specifically identify and characterize biological structures
        in cells and tissues. Here, blue-fluorescent light is emitted by the stain
        called `DAPI,` which labels all cell nuclei. But many biomolecules in tissue
        naturally emit light as well � a term called �autofluorescence.� Autofluorescence
        in the green channel (`AF488`) is shown. During analysis, it is important
        to distinguish between light emitted from fluorescence that was artificially
        added and that which naturally occurs in tissue, for each channel imaged.

      Description: Local autofluorescence, in addition to average autofluorescence,
        should also be considered. The colon crypts � which are responsible for renewing
        the lining of the intestine and making mucus � tend to autofluoresce more
        than some other structures.

      Description: 'Canonically, cancer cells divide more rapidly than non-malignant
        cells. A physician may order a `Ki-67` test to determine the rate of cell
        division in a specimen that may be suspected of cancer, as a way of measuring
        how quickly cells are dividing. While `Ki-67` is prevalent in both normal
        and tumor cells, in this colorectal cancer specimen, the frequency of `Ki-67`
        positive cells seem to be higher in the tumor (`Keratin`) region than the
        stroma (`aSMA`). '

      Description: An orchestrated immune response to cancer depends on the ability
        of white blood cells (lymphocytes) to successfully infiltrate the tumor region
        and interact with the cancer cells.  But tumors can be resistant to immune
        responses, making immune infiltration an important prognostic marker. The
        density of these immune populations changes across the tissue and it is therefore
        important to compare these changes across regions of tumor and stroma. In
        this colon adenocarcinoma tissue, it appears that T cells (`CD3`) can more
        successfully infiltrate the tumor region than B cells (`CD20`).
