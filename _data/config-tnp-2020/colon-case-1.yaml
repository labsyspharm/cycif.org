    The NCI-funded [Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN)](https://humantumoratlas.org/) is a 
    multi-institutional effort to collect, analyze, and create a database of multi-omic data 
    for a variety of human cancers. 

    The SARDANA trans-network project (TNP) was designed to optimize the repeatability, 
    interpretability, and accessibility of data for the atlas. The SARDANA TNP will 
    distribute a set of common tissue samples to participating HTAN centers, allowing them 
    to generate a spatial cell census using each center’s imaging method of choice. 
    Data generated during the TNP will be used to stress-test data standards and informatic 
    systems and compare results across experimental approaches and organizations.

    In this Minerva Story, we share multiplexed immunofluorescence images of a single serial 
    section of this tissue collected using the CyCIF method at Harvard. This story introduces 
    viewers to structural features and cell populations that can be visualized using carefully 
    selected markers.

      Description: |
        The tissue was resected from a 69-year-old man with a recent history 
        of both cutaneous melanoma and gastric marginal zone lymphoma of MALT type. He 
        presented to medical attention following recurrent syncopal episodes (fainting spells) 
        and falls secondary to anemia and orthostatic hypotension (decreased blood pressure 
        upon standing). A colonoscopy identified a large mass in the right colon. Resection 
        of a portion of the right colon and terminal ileum revealed a 6.2 cm hard, exophytic 
        mass in the cecum immediately adjacent to the ileocecal valve. In this
        area of the specimen, the tumor has invaded the muscularis propria (`aSMA`) of the bowel 
        wall into the peri-colonic epithelial tissue (`keratin`). There is also a region of 
        neighboring normal epithelium.

      Description: The density of immune populations can differ across the tissue
        tumor and stroma. In this tissue, there seems to be more T cell (`CD3`) 
        infiltration than  B cell (`CD20`) infiltration
        in the tumor regions.

      Description: Small aggregations of T cells (`CD3`), and to a larger extent
        B cells (`CD20`), mark lymphoid follicles. These structures are involved in
        immune surveillance and normal mucosal regeneration. However, the number, diameter, 
        density, and activation of lymphoid follicles can increase during tumor 
        invasion.

        endogenous fluorophores. Green channel (AF488) autofluorescence is 
        shown here.
