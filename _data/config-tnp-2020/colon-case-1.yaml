    The Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) funded by the NCI is a multi-institutional effort 
    to collect, analyze, and create a database of multi-omic data for a variety of human cancers.

    SARDANA is a trans-network project (TNP) within the HTAN led by Peter Sorger at Harvard Medical School 
    that focuses on optimizing the repeatability, interpretability, and accessibility of data 
    for the atlas. The TNP will distribute a set of common tissue samples to participating 
    HTAN Centers, allowing them to generate a spatial cell census using each centerâ€™s imaging 
    method of choice. Data generated in the TNP will be used to stress-test data standards 
    and informatic systems and compare results across experimental approaches and organizations.

    In this Minerva story, we share multiplexed immunofluorescence images collected using the 
    CyCIF method at Harvard, introducing viewers through select markers and tissue features 
    to guide analysis.

    This tissue specimen was resected from a 69-year old white male and is a stage IIIB 
    colon adenocarcinoma with a BRAF (V600E) mutation

        In this follicle, it appears as though the B cells are spread throughout the
        follicle, while the T cells (`CD3`) cluster around the outside of the follicle.

      Description: An orchestrated immune response to cancer depends on the ability
        of white blood cells (lymphocytes) to successfully infiltrate the tumor region
        and interact with the cancer cells.  But tumors can be resistant to immune
        responses, making immune infiltration an important prognostic marker. The
        density of these immune populations changes across the tissue and it is therefore
        important to compare these changes across regions of tumor and stroma. In
        this colon adenocarcinoma tissue, it appears that T cells (`CD3`) can more
        successfully infiltrate the tumor region than B cells (`CD20`).

        division in a specimen that may be suspected of cancer, as a way of measuring
        how quickly cells are dividing. While `Ki-67` is prevalent in both normal
        and tumor cells, in this colorectal cancer specimen, the frequency of `Ki-67`
        positive cells seem to be higher in the tumor (`Keratin`) region than the

      Description: Fluorescence imaging is a powerful tool that adds fluorescent molecules
        to tissue to specifically identify and characterize biological structures
        in cells and tissues. Here, blue-fluorescent light is emitted by the stain
        called `DAPI,` which labels all cell nuclei. But many biomolecules in tissue
        naturally emit light as well a term called autofluorescence. Autofluorescence
        in the green channel (`AF488`) is shown. During analysis, it is important
        to distinguish between light emitted from fluorescence that was artificially
        added and that which naturally occurs in tissue, for each channel imaged.
