    Explore images of heart tissue from a patient who experienced 
    multiple myocardial infarcts that occurred at different times. 
    
    The deceased patient is a 61-year-old 
    female with a medical history of coronary artery disease, heart failure, 
    type II diabetes mellitus, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
    
    The patient arrived at the ED with respiratory distress 
    from influenza A and experienced a cardiac arrest with pulseless 
    electrical activity (PEA arrest) from which she was succesfully resuscitated. 
    However, following PEA arrest, she did not recover consciousness and began displaying 
    upper and lower bilateral extremity twitching; during a 
    neurologic exam, she displayed trace corneal responses and 
    reactive pupils. An electroencephalogram confirmed status epilepticus. 
    She was administered multiple anti-epileptic medications but continued 
    to have breakthrough seizures. CT scans and x-rays were also 
    concerning for pneumonia, and sputum culture was positive 
    Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The patient was placed on broad 
    spectrum antibiotics.
    
    In addition to infection and seizures, the patient developed 
    sinus tachycardia with significant ST depression, indicating acute ischemia. 
    Given the multiple severe ongoing clinical issues and poor prognosis, a collective
    decision by the family was made to transition the goals of care to 
    "comfort measures". She passed away the same day.
    
    Below are multiple tissue sections from the patientâ€™s heart extracted 
    at autopsy. Present are multiple myocardial infarctions, occurring days (acute), 
    weeks (subacute), and years (remote) prior to death, in both 
    the left and right ventricles along with severe atherosclerosis in the arteries.
