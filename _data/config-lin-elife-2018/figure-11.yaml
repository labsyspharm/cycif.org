      Description: |
        Molecular heterogeneity in a single GBM tumor. (A) Representative low magnification image of a GBM specimen generated from 221 stitched 10X frames; the sample was subjected to 10 rounds of t-CyCIF.

      Description: |
        Zoom level 1 (millimeter scale): A GBM sample from single patient shows highly spatial heterogeneity, indicated from `EGFR` expression, `p-ERK` which is downstream of `EGFR`, and `Keratin` used as an tumor marker.

    - Name: Zoom level 2 (hundreds micrometers)
      Description: |
        Zoom level 2 (several hundred micrometers): Zoomed into a single lobe of this GBM sample, the clear territories can be defined by either `EGFR` high and `p-ERK` high.

    - Name: Zoom level 3 (Single-cell)
      Description: |
        Zoom level 3 (Single-cell): When zoomed into single-cell resolution, though now you can still appreciate the heterogeneity while in the `EGFR` (Red) high region there are still few sparse `p-ERK` high cells (Green).

    - Name: Zoom level 3 (Cont.)
      Description: |
        Zoom level 3 (Cont.): The heterogeneity is less obvious in other dimensions, as shown here with PCNA staining (Gree). Such demonstrated that the proliferative status can be governed by different upstream signalling pathways or their combinations.
