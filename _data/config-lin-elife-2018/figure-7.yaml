      Description: |
        Small intestine which resected with PDAC, `PCNA` shows nice crypts and cilia are labeled strongly with `beta-catenin` (Red). Some representative images from the same region could be found in Figure 7C.

    - Name: PDAC Region
      Description: |
        PDAC are inflated with immune cells, labeled with `CD45` and `CD4`. Notably, this region also expressed highest `PD-L1`, eliciting a possible immune evasion mechanism. Corresponsive figures and data for Figure 8B-D.
