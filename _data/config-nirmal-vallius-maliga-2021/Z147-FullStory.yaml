      Description: 'In this Story, we are giving a tour of a unique sample of a NF1
        mut, BRAF wt melanoma, which contains multiple fields of disease progression.
        From left to right, the regions highlighted show melanoma in situ, polypoid
        exophytic tumor growth, and regions of invasive melanoma. Throughout this Story,
        we present findings from our paper that describe and deeply characterize these
        unique regions by CyCIF, single-cell profiling, and microregional sequencing.
        Each of these heterogeneous areas are comprised of different cell types ranging
        from keratinocytes (Pan-CK+) and melanocytes (SOX10+) to various subsets of
        immune (CD3d+ T cells, CD11C+ and/or CD163+ myeloid cells) and stromal cells,
        which we will discuss and highlight later.

      Description: 'A closer look of the Melanoma In Situ (MIS) region illustrates the
        horizontal axis of melanoma regression from left to right with a decreasing
        number of melanocytes (SOX10+, green) in the Pan-CK (pan Cytokeratin)+ epidermis.
        The region highlighted in the left contains MIS with dermal macrophages and
        a moderate T cell (CD3d+) infiltration in the adjacent dermal region. The MIS
        region with inflammatory regression in the middle is characterized by the presence
        and abundance of T cells and myeloid cells (CD11c+ and/or CD163+) in the dermal
        field which directly abuts epidermis. Notably, a majority of the T cells infiltrating
        into epidermis within this region are exhausted (PD1+ TIM3+ and/or LAG3+; data
        shown in Waypoint #13). The terminal regression of melanoma does not contain
        any melanocytes, but harbors a dense infiltrate of T cells.

        and the right-hand box is the stroma adjacent to the invasive boundary. Although
        both of these regions contain abundant exhausted T cells, the outcome of the
        immune editing process depends on their interactions with other neighboring
        stromal cells and their proximity to tumor cells (i.e. different immune editing
        in the melanoma in situ (MIS) versus invasive melanoma (IM); leading to tumor
        regression in the MIS and the formation of a resulting protective tumor microenvironment
        in the IM).

        cells (cyan), myeloid cells (yellow) and vasculature (red). Identifying specific
        phenotypes allows us to study cell-to-cell interactions and the tissue structure
        in great detail.

      Description: To study similarities and differences among SOX10+ tumor cells, we
        performed unsupervised clustering using 30 different CyCIF markers following
        single-cell phenotyping. This yielded six clusters (T1-4, T5a and T5b), which
        were differentiated by the expression of melanoma associated markers. The violin
        plot below illustrates the marker expression as well as the percentage of total
        tumor cells that make up each tumor cell cluster. The spatial information linked
        to the single-cell data allowed us to observe that a proportion of the clusters
        were spatially organized.

      Description: Another spatially restricted cluster (T5a) had SOX10+ tumor cells
        expressing high levels of major histocompatibility complex-II (MHC-II). Although
        MHC-II is primarily expressed on antigen presenting immune cells, exposure to
        interferon gamma (IFNy) can lead to up-regulation of MHC-II also in tumor cells.
        These MHC-II+ cells were enriched at the leading edge of the invasive melanoma
        adjacent to the stroma (arrow) suggesting signals from the tumor microenvironment
        can drive tumor heterogeneity. We observed an up-regulation of interferon-gamma
        in the invasive boundary of the invasive melanoma via microregional transcriptomics
        (inset top). Additionally, neighborhood analysis revealed there was a significant
        co-occurrence between PDL1+ macrophages and cells in cluster T5a (inset bottom).

      Description: When evaluating the immune subsets in the various stages of melanoma
        progression, we observed that T cells were abundant in the stromal region adjacent
        to the invasive tumor boundary -- this is what we refer to as the brisk tumor
        infiltrating lymphocyte (bTIL) region outlined in the box. Although a minor
        proportion of T cells are infiltrating the tumor region (arrows), the majority
        of T cells are restricted to the stroma. Here, the majority of CD8+ T cells
        (refered to as CTLs) are either activated (PD1+) or exhausted (PD1+ TIM3+ and/or
        LAG3+). TIM3+ CD8- cells were further identified as CD11C+ dendritic cells (data
        not shown). Microregional transcriptomics highlights that genes related to T
        cell exhaustion were up-regulated within the bTIL region in comparison to the
        exophytic melanoma (EM) region (inset).
