CCOC invades surrounding structures and carries a risk of recurrence and metastasis to regional lymph nodes and distant sites (1). More than 80% of CCOCs exhibit EWSR1 gene rearrangement (1,2). The standard of care is surgical gross total resection with wide margins. For cases where surgical margins are close, adjuvant radiotherapy may be administered to reduce the risk of recurrence.\n\nThe image shows a CCOC tissue section stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), which label DNA and RNA in the nucleus (purple), and proteins in the cytoplasm and ECM (pink), respectively. \n\nReferences:\n1\tWright, J.
