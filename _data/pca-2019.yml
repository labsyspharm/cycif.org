  title: Melanoma Pre-Cancer Atlas (HTAN)
  authors: Unpublished t-CyCIF of melanoma and precursor fields from two patients. The biopsy from patient 1 illustrates regions of melanocytic dysplasia, normal immune resolution of early melanoma and immune evasion by invasive melanoma. Three separate biopsies from patient 2 illustrate a variety of histologic presentations from precursor fields and melanoma in situ to invasive and exophytic melanoma.
