The left-hand box highlights a region of inflammatory regression and the right-hand box highlights stroma adjacent to the invasive boundary (brisk TIL region). Although both of these regions contain abundant exhausted T cells, the outcome of the immune editing process depends on their interactions with other neighboring immune and stromal cells and their proximity to tumor cells (i.e. different immune editing in melanoma in situ (MIS) than invasive melanoma (IM)); leading to tumor regression in the MIS and the formation of a resulting protective tumor microenvironment in the IM.","Arrows":[],"Overlays":[{"x":0.3853734837455114,"y":0.746629475768632,"width":0.08920400687117147,"height":0.030890433474822565},{"x":0.9549552520006592,"y":0.5527762452888777,"width":0.06556336900778681,"height":0.03183605898935804}],"Group":"Immune editing","Masks":[],"ActiveMasks":[],"Zoom":1.275634592203508,"Pan":[0.7161848095804741,0.6263774311702153]},{"Name":"Interferon-gamma signaling","Description":"Unsupervised clustering of all SOX10+ tumor cells in specimen MEL1 resulted in six distinct tumor clusters. One of the clusters, T5b, was spatially restricted to the invasive tumor boundary (arrow) and had tumor cells expressing high levels of major histocompatibility complex-II (MHC-II; inset top). Although MHC-II is primarily expressed on antigen presenting immune cells, exposure to interferon-gamma (IFNy) can lead to up-regulation of MHC-II in tumor cells as well. We observed an up-regulation of interferon-gamma in the invasive tumor boundary (IB) via microregional transcriptomics, suggesting signals from the tumor microenvironment can drive tumor heterogeneity. Additionally, neighborhood analysis revealed there was a significant co-occurrence between PDL1+ macrophages and cells in cluster T5b (inset bottom).\n![](../images/full_story_waypoint12_spatially_restricted_tumor_states_II_v3.jpg)","Arrows":[{"Text":"","HideArrow":false,"Point":[1.0851265781001898,0.46361415569972725],"Angle":60},{"Text":"","HideArrow":false,"Point":[1.0967929794830094,0.4894075085751976],"Angle":60},{"Text":"","HideArrow":false,"Point":[1.1258105014679134,0.47735929769257657],"Angle":60}],"Overlays":[],"Group":"IFNg signaling","Masks":[],"ActiveMasks":[],"Zoom":9.478071799463793,"Pan":[1.0921476305687594,0.47581084805449325]},{"Name":"PDL1+ dendritic cells ","Description":"The spatial cell-to-cell proximity analysis revealed significant co-localization of CD11C+ PDL1+ dendritic cells (orange) and terminally exhausted TIM3+ T cells (cyan), suggesting PDL1-PD1 ligand-receptor interactions between these cell types and that PDL1+ myeloid cells are one of the drivers of immune suppression within the invasive tumor front. To confirm the findings from the proximity analysis, we performed high-resolution 3D imaging of the invasive front in specimen MEL1 and observed frequent synapse formation between PD1+ CTLs and either PDL1+ macrophages or PDL1+ dendritic cells with concentration of PD1 and PDL1 at the site of cell-to-cell interaction (inset video).\n<video width=\"320\" height=\"180\" controls autoplay muted loop><source src=\"../images/PCA_22.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video>","Arrows":[],"Overlays":[],"Group":"PDL1-positive dendritic cells","Masks":[],"ActiveMasks":[],"Zoom":6.58199430518319,"Pan":[0.9958587776065482,0.5556209507367248]},{"Name":"Tumor cell communities","Description":"Recurrent spatial patterns within the malignant tumor were studied by computing spatial lag vectors and clustering them, resulting in 10 distinct tumor cell communities (TCC). At the invasive boundary, seven communities were identified, with each community forming a relatively narrow layer of cells separated from the central core. The layered arrangement of tumor cells was mainly organized by MITF levels, proliferative index and response to the stroma. For example, the TCC8 MITFhigh KI67low community was found internal to the TCC3 MHC-IIhigh KI67high community which constitutes the outermost tumor layer, consistent with data from mrSEQ, suggesting induction by stroma-derived IFNy. Bar plots below show the percentage of S100B, S100A, MITF and KI67 positive cells within each tumor cell community (TCC1-10).\n![](../images/abstract_waypoint6_Tumor_cell_communities_v2.png)","Arrows":[],"Overlays":[],"Group":"Tumor cell communities ","Masks":["TCC1","TCC2","TCC3","TCC4","TCC5","TCC6","TCC7","TCC8","TCC9","TCC10"],"ActiveMasks":["TCC1","TCC2","TCC3","TCC4","TCC5","TCC6","TCC7","TCC8","TCC9","TCC10"],"Zoom":5.665828661833209,"Pan":[0.9765908464281882,0.5308367829340729]}]}],"Masks":[{"Path":"all-cells","Name":"all cells","Colors":["ffffff"],"Channels":["all cells"]},{"Path":"stroma","Name":"stroma","Colors":["308e36"],"Channels":["stroma"]},{"Path":"TCC1","Name":"TCC1","Colors":["ef476f"],"Channels":["TCC1"]},{"Path":"TCC10","Name":"TCC10","Colors":["5e6472"],"Channels":["TCC10"]},{"Path":"TCC3","Name":"TCC3","Colors":["ffd166"],"Channels":["TCC3"]},{"Path":"TCC4","Name":"TCC4","Colors":["118ab2"],"Channels":["TCC4"]},{"Path":"TCC6","Name":"TCC6","Colors":["ffa69e"],"Channels":["TCC6"]},{"Path":"TCC5","Name":"TCC5","Colors":["073b4c"],"Channels":["TCC5"]},{"Path":"TCC7","Name":"TCC7","Colors":["faf3dd"],"Channels":["TCC7"]},{"Path":"TCC8","Name":"TCC8","Colors":["b8f2e6"],"Channels":["TCC8"]},{"Path":"TCC2","Name":"TCC2","Colors":["06d6a0"],"Channels":["TCC2"]},{"Path":"TCC9","Name":"TCC9","Colors":["9a8c98"],"Channels":["TCC9"]}],"Groups":[{"Name":"Immune editing","Path":"Immune-editing_0__DNA--11__CD8A--31__PD1--6__Pan-CK--3__SOX10","Colors":["0000ff","00ff00","ff0000","ffbb00","ffffff"],"Channels":["DNA","CD8A","PD1","Pan-CK","SOX10"]},{"Name":"PDL1-positive dendritic cells","Path":"PDL1-positive-dendritic-cells_0__DNA--3__SOX10--30__CD11C--15__PDL1","Colors":["0000ff","ffffff","00ff00","ff0000"],"Channels":["DNA","SOX10","CD11C","PDL1"]},{"Name":"Tumor cell communities ","Path":"Tumor-cell-communities_0__DNA--3__SOX10","Colors":["ffffff","00ff00"],"Channels":["DNA","SOX10"]},{"Name":"IFNg signaling","Path":"IFNg-signaling_0__DNA--30__CD11C--27__HLADPB1--3__SOX10","Colors":["0000ff","00ff00","ff0000","ffffff"],"Channels":["DNA","CD11C","HLADPB1","SOX10"]},{"Name":"Tissue Architecture","Path":"Tissue-Architecture_26__aSMA--10__CD3D--39__CD31--6__Pan-CK--3__SOX10","Colors":["00ffff","ffffff","ff0000","ffbb00","00ff00"],"Channels":["aSMA","CD3D","CD31","Pan-CK","SOX10"]}]}
