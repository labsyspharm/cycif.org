## Antibodies for tissue-based CyCIF

To date, we have tested commercial antibodies against ~200 proteins for their
compatibility with t-CyCIF. These antibodies include lineage makers,
cytoskeletal proteins, cell cycle regulators, the phosphorylated forms of
signaling proteins and kinases, transcription factors, markers of cell state
including quiescence, senescence, apoptosis, stress, etc.
