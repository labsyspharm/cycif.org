## Center for Pre-cancer Atlases of Cutaneous and Hematologic Origin (PATCH)

Melanoma is a common type of cancer that can be treated with minor surgery when it is localized but which becomes lethal when it metastasizes. Unfortunately, primary tumors often become metastatic when they are small, making melanoma a dangerous disease. Our program seeks to answer the following questions about. 

* What is the sequence of events that leads to metastatic melanoma and how does disease progression differ with anatomic location? 

* Why does the immune system successfully clear many pre-melanomas but fail with others? 

* How can we improve the accuracy of early diagnosis and how can treatment be improved for cancers that do progress to metastatic disease? 

The HMS PATCH Center is a component of the National Cancer Institute [Human Tumor Atlas Network](https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/moonshot-cancer-initiative/implementation/human-tumor-atlas) (HTAN), a multi-center program within the National Cancer Institute that emerged from the [Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot Initiative](https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/moonshot-cancer-initiative). The HTAN aims to construct high resolution, publically-accessible data on the spatial, genetic and epigenetic features of common human cancers and pre-cancers. The HMS PATCH Center is focused on mechanisms underlying expansion of specific clones in normal and diseased niches as shaped by complex interactions with immune and stromal cells. We are developing computational models and high accuracy datasets of mechanisms driving progression from pre-malignant to malignant disease as a means to identify high risk individuals, prioritize particular therapies and create perform "precision prevention trials" in the future. The pre-melanoma atlas is being created using integrated characterization of single cell genotype and cell states using high-plex tissue imaging (with the CyCIF approach) and genomic/transcriptomic characterization of cross-sectional and well-controlled longitudinal patient cohorts.

## Omic and Multidimensional Spatial (OMS) Atlas

The [OMS Atlas](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/basic-science-departments/biomedical-engineering/spatial-systems-biomedicine/research/OMS-Human-Cancer-Atlas.cfm) Center based at the Oregon Health Sciences University (OHSU) and led by [Joe Gray](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/basic-science-departments/biomedical-engineering/people/joe-gray.cfm) is a component of the National Cancer Institute [Human Tumor Atlas Network](https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/moonshot-cancer-initiative/implementation/human-tumor-atlas) (HTAN), a multi-center program within the National Cancer Institute that emerged from the [Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot Initiative](https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/moonshot-cancer-initiative). Our team us a collaborator on the OMS Atlas focusing on the application of multi-dimensional CyCIF imaging methods to clinical trial samples. 

The OMS is focused on elucidating mechanisms of therapy resistance in three clinical scenarios in which disease recurrence is a major concern: (a) hormone-receptor positive breast cancer (HRBC) undergoing treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy, (b) triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) undergoing treatment with a PARP inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent (c) castration resistance prostate cancer (CRPC) undergoing treatment with enzalutamide. Diverse imaging and omic methods are being applied to this analysis including several complementary ways to create spatial maps of cell types and states. These include multiplex immuno-histochemistry, CyCIF, Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscope (FIB-SEM).

## Center for Cancer Systems Pharmacology

The HMS [Center for Cancer Systems Pharmacology](https://ccsp.hms.harvard.edu/) (CCSP) is an [NCI Cancer Systems Biology Center of Excellence](https://csbconsortium.org/) that studies responsiveness and resistance to anti-cancer drugs. The Center focuses on targeted small molecule therapies and newly emerging immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), two cornerstones of precision cancer medicine. Using precision medicine approaches our team is attempting to answer these key questions:

* How can we identify patients who will benefit from specific anti-cancer medicines and how can side-effects be minimized? 

* Why do only some tumors respond to drugs, and why do those that do respond frequently become drug resistant? 

* How should the choice between chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy be made to optimize treatment for individual patients? The Center is committed to training students and postdocs, promoting junior faculty and ensuring that  data and software are reproducible, reliable and publicly accessible   

Highly multiplexed imaging methods such as t-CyCIF are being used in the CCSP to immuno-profile tumors from patients before and after treatment. Nascent tumors are under continuous surveillance by the immune system and suppression of this surveillance is one of the key steps in development of malignancy. Drugs acting as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) restore anti-tumor immunity and result in very durable responses (potentially even cures) in some diseases. The key to understanding why ICIs work in some tumor types and not others is understanding a complex tumor milieu (the tumor microenvironment; TME) in which tumor, stromal and immune cells interact. The precise proportions and spatiotemporal arrangements of tumor, stromal and immune cells are being measured in tissue biopsies, and single-cell features extracted and associated with disease progression and therapeutic response using machine learning, deep learning and high-dimensional data analysis.

## Ludwig Tumor Atlas

The Ludwig Tumor Atlas is a wide-ranging collaborative project involving members of the [Ludwig Center at Harvard Medical School](https://ludwigcenter.hms.harvard.edu/) and [Ludwig Cancer Research Centers](http://www.ludwigcancerresearch.org/) elsewhere in the U.S. and Europe. The overall aim of the Atlas is to investigate the basis of intrinsic and acquired resistance to anti-cancer drugs and to thereby develop new biomarkers, therapies and clinical protocols for overcoming or avoiding such resistance.

Drug resistance is the greatest single challenge facing contemporary cancer therapy. Despite extraordinary advances in cancer therapeutics, most patients eventually relapse and succumb to disease due to the development of drug resistance. The problem of resistance is complicated by tumor heterogeneityâ€“ including remarkable heterogeneity within an individual tumor and among tumors at different sites in the same patient. Tumors and their microenvironments are also plastic, changing through the course of disease and in response to drugs.  High dimensional tissue imaging and single cell genetics are being used to characterize this heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales, often in biopsies from patients prior to and during therapy, and then following relapse. Such data are being assembled into Atlas designed to guide next generation diagnosis and drug development.
